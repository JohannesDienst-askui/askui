## Installation via Terminal (Silent Mode)
Use the downloaded executable file (**.exe**) for silent installation, which allows you to choose the installation directory and components. To install silently, run the following command terminal (Application **CMD**) with Administrator privileges:

```shell
"<installer_path>" /qn
```

**Options:**

- `/l*v "<log_file_path>"`: Set the installer log file path.
- `APPDIR="<installation_directory>"`: Specify the installation directory.
- `INSTALL_ADK="NO"`: Skip AskUI Development Environment installation.
    - `INSTALL_NODE="NO"`: Skip Isolated Node environment installation.
    - `INSTALL_ASKUI_RUNNER="NO"`: Skip AskUI Runner installation.
    - `HTTP_ADDRESS="<proxy_http_address>"`: Set the HTTP proxy address.
    - `HTTPS_ADDRESS="<proxy_https_address>"`: Set the HTTPS proxy address.
- `CONFIGURE_WINDOWS_FIREWALL="NO"`: Skip Windows Firewall configuration.

### Example
This command installs all components silently and sets the HTTP proxy address to http://proxy.example.com:

```shell
"<installer_path>" /qn HTTP_ADDRESS="http://proxy.example.com"
```
