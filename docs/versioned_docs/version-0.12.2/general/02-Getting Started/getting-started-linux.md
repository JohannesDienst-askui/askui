# Install AskUI Linux

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or above
- __npm__ in version 7.10 or above (usually comes with the Node.js installation)
- A text editor/IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- :warning: [Information for Wayland](../07-Troubleshooting/linux.md#wayland).

## Installation

Open a directory where you would like to place the AskUI setup. If you havenâ€™t already, set up an NPM project by running:

```shell
npm init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file inside your present working directory which contains the configuration of your project including a description of its dependencies.

Install `askui` and other dependencies for writing and executing tests:

```shell
npm i --save-dev askui @askui/askui-reporters @askui/jest-allure-circus typescript ts-node @types/jest ts-jest jest
```
